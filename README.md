**Project#1 What's underneath**

What's Underneath game [HTML, DOM, CSS, JavaScript]
General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive 20 Unit 1 Project - What's Underneath
Check out the game here! https://mau-dev.github.io/Project1-What-is-underneath/

**Instructions and Objectives**
Guess what's underneath and describe the hidden illustration with one word to win. Click on the squares to reveal any part of the hidden image. Type your answer into the input field and submit. Less squares you reveal before guessing, higher the score.

**Technologies Used**
Only using basic HTML, CSS, DOM Manipulation and Javascript

**Approach Taken**
This game will help me review and shore up my javascript basics.
Started the game by creating all of the elements using DOM manipulation, the game starts with no elements in the body of the HTML file.
I created an intro screen with title, instruction button that leads to the instruction screen, and start button to start the game.
I created the game board with 100 clickable parts that the player can click to reveal that part of the underneath image.

**Unsolved Problems**
I am working on the dinamic score board, to store player's name, score for current guess and overall score. The input to match the photo of the array.
I need to calculate the score based on square revealed before the input. I need to shuffle the array, and pop the used combinations in another array, in order to have randomly choosed next image, and not repeat same images in a round.

**Disclaimer**
The illustrations are borrowed from dribble, by varous designers.
